You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Ideas:
stair i can be reached from i-1 or i-2
In another word, ways of getting stair i equals to ways of reaching i-1 plus ways of reaching i-2
