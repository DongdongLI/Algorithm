/*
  Given an integer array, find three numbers whose product is maximum and output the maximum product.

  Example 1:
  Input: [1,2,3]
  Output: 6
  Example 2:
  Input: [1,2,3,4]
  Output: 24
  Note:
  The length of the given array will be in range [3,104] and all elements are in the range [-1000, 1000].
  Multiplication of any three numbers in the input won't exceed the range of 32-bit signed integer.
*/

/*
   Even though we can narrow down all the cases to this two, we should list out here:
   
   3 or more elements are positive
    both cases are possible
   1 to 2 elements larger or equal to 0
    x x x x x 1 2 
      case 1
    x x x x x x 1
      case 2
    
   all elements are less or equal to 0
    case 1
    
    tip?
    Try it out, write it down
