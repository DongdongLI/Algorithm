/*
  We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

  I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
  
  Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
  
  You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
  
  -1 : My number is lower
   1 : My number is higher
   0 : Congrats! You got it!
  Example:
  n = 10, I pick 6.
  
  Return 6.
*/

/*
  Binary search. Start from the middle, if it is not the one, either go for the first half or the second half.
*/

/* The guess API is defined in the parent class GuessGame.
   @param num, your guess
   @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
      int guess(int num); */
