/*
  Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing all 1's and return its area.

  For example, given the following matrix:

  1 0 1 0 0
  1 0 1 1 1
  1 1 1 1 1
  1 0 0 1 0
  Return 4.

    Idea:
      Dynamic Programming is obvious:
        t[i][j]=min(t[i][j-1],t[i-1][j],t[i-1][j-1])+1
