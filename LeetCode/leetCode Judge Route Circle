/*
  Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

  The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

  Example 1:
  Input: "UD"
  Output: true
  Example 2:
  Input: "LL"
  Output: false

/*
  In order to get back to the original spot, the robot need to move right for the same distance as it moves left, same as up and down
