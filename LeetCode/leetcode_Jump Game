/*
 Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

For example:
A = [2,3,1,1,4], return true.

A = [3,2,1,0,4], return false. 
*/

/*ideas:
1.maxreach records the furthest index you can go
2.step let you know how many steps you can move from current position, and it minus 1 at the beginning of each loop indicating the 
move
