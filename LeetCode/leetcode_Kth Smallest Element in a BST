/*
  Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

  Note: 
  You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
  
  Follow up:
  What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? 
  How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
*/

/*
  Trivia Solution:
  
  Inorder Traversal will get the value of all the nodes in increasing order.
  As long as the traverse set has become as large as k, then we have found the target
