    Given a positive integer, return its corresponding column title as appear in an Excel sheet.

        1 -> A
        2 -> B
        3 -> C
        ...
        26 -> Z
        27 -> AA
        28 -> AB 
*/

/*
    after AZ it's BZ
    so its like 26-base
    
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ... 25 then back to 0 (instead it's encoded in letter)
    AZ->BA, BZ->CA,... etc
    
    0 is map to A, so we need n-- each time
    
    start from the rear, so need to reverse in the end
