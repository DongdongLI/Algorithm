/*
    An animal shelter holds only dogs and cats, and operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either
    the "oldest" of all animals , or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or cat (and will receive the oldest of that
    type).
    
    Create the data structure to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog and dequeueCat.
    You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.
