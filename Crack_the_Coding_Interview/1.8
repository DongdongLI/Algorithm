Assume you have a method isSubstring.
Given two strings, s1 and s2. Check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring

Assume we know the position of the rotation, then we can use x to decode the first part and y for the second part.
So s1=xy and s2=yx

And s1+s1=xyxy

So, if s2 is a rotation of s1, it has to be a substring of s1+s1
